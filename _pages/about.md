I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics in Dresden/Goethe University Frankfurt, working in theoretical Physics. My research interests lie at the intersection of topology and (strong) correlations in condensed matter, in particular crystalline matter. In particular, I am interested in the classification and identification of topological phases in strongly correlated matter, such as Mott insulators, Kondo insulators, Kondo-Weyl semimetals. I use a multitude of many-body methods, such as CPT, DMFT, DFT+DMFT, ED.

I am also very passionate about education and social justice in and outside of academia. In particular, I am interested in the representation of women. non-binary, gender-nonconforming, and in general queer people in academia and my approach is an intersectional one. 

If any of these topics are of interest to you and would like to connect, do not hesitate to contact me at diana.oprea@cpfs.mpg.de.
