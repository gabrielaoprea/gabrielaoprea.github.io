I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics in Dresden/Goethe University Frankfurt, working in theoretical Physics. My research interests lie at the intersection of topology and (strong) correlations in condensed matter, in particular crystalline matter. In particular, I am interested in the classification and identification of topological phases in strongly correlated matter, such as Mott insulators, Kondo insulators, Kondo-Weyl semimetals. I use a multitude of many-body methods, such as CPT, DMFT, DFT+DMFT, ED.
