Work experience
======
* Summer 2018: Research Intern
  * Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China
  * Area: Experimental Chemistry
  * Duties included: Designing, synthesising, and testing catalysts for the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) which is a potential alternative for carbon dioxide capture and usage.

* Summer 2017: Research Intern
  * University of Oxford, UK
  * Area: Theoretical Chemistry
  * Duties included: Writing code and performing simulations at a classical level on Coulomb explosions of molecules, in particular iodoethane and iodopropane.
  * Supervisor: Michael Burt

* 2018: Part II Student
  * University of Oxford, UK
  * Area: Theoretical Chemistry
  * Duties included: Studying the convergence of MP perturbation theory for excited states, and its relation to the reference state, the energy landscape of the reference state, and the singularity structure of the reference state.
  * Supervisor: Hugh Burton
